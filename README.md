## Description

This is a MERN stack application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) their own notes. I'm honestly very confused about how this this,but this is my last week of class and I'm trying to get this done. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get this done in time. I'm going to try my best to get this done. I will resubmit this once i figure out how to get this done.
